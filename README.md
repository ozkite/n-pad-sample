### ✅ How to Add This to Your Repo

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/n-pad-clean  # or wherever your empty/clean repo is
echo "# N-Pad – A Swipe App for the Nouns Community

> A temporary frontend demo showcasing the UI/UX and basic interaction flow of a swipe-based app for the **[Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf)** community.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a **proof-of-concept frontend** designed to:
- Demonstrate a Tinder-style swipe interface for Nouns
- Showcase clean, modern design aligned with Nouns' aesthetic
- Simulate core interactions (swipe left/right, noun card display)
- Serve as a visual prototype for feedback or presentation

💡 **Note**: This is **not a production-ready dApp**. It includes no blockchain integration, voting logic, or backend — just frontend structure and mock functionality for demo purposes.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (animations)
- React Context (state management)
- Vercel (hosting)
